# SentimentAnalysisModel
This was a final project for a grad-level Machine Learning class. 
Included in the repo is a write-up explaining the performance, and a jupyter notebook containing all the code.

Please refer to the SentimentAnalysisWriteup.pdf document for a discussion on model performance.
Please note that there are still improvements that could be made with this model.
